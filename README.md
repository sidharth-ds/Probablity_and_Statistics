## Probablity_&_Stats_1:

- Numpy concepts for probablity:
    - np.array_split()
    - np.random.choice([]), corresponding probablity percentages
    - np.random.shuffle(x)
- Permutation & Combination:
    - import itertools as it, it.permutations(), it.combinations()
- various Distribution plots:
    - distplot (outdated), displot, kdeplot
- Normal distribution: (Continuous)
    - loc = Mean, scale = Standard deviation, variance
- Binomial distribution: (Discrete)
    - A Binomial Distribution shows either (S)uccess or (F)ailure.
    - used for linear regression data
    - 'p' is mean value in binomial

## Probablity_&_Stats_2:

- Poisson distribution (discrete):
    - focuses on larger distribution area
    - lambda value : is like Mean value or expected value.
- Uniform distribution:
    - no peak at the mean
    - data is distributed evenly (even y_axis)
- Logistic distribution:
    - if data is regressive data, but it is of binary form.
    - regressive means relativity, logistics means binary predictors.
- Chi_Squared test:
    - The purpose of this test is to determine if a difference between observed data and expected data is due to chance, or if it is due to a relationship between the variables you are studying.
- Chi aquare distribution: only for Classification data(discrete), not for Regression data(continuous)
    - Degree of Freedom : logically indepedent variables
- ML algorithm for Chi_Square
